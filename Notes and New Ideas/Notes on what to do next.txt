"The first type methods are hierarchical structure
(tree) based methods, such as KD-tree [3], [13] ,Randomized
KD-tree [30], K-means tree"
-These perform well when the dimension fo the data is low


"The second type methods are hashing based methods,
such as Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) [17], Spectral
Hashing [34], Iterative Quantization [36] and so on"


KD trees
inverted indicies
	allow fast full text seraches
	popular data structure for search engines
	high dimensional data
fingerprinting

another way to solve this is through kNN graphs although its limitations
are often in high computational costs

data sets
	look for this possibly
